<h1>How to Volunteer</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        Campus Kitchens at Georgia Tech relies on volunteer assistance to package meals,
        update our inventory, and move meals from dining halls to Klemis. We need your help to
        keep Klemis fully stocked for students in need!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can sign up for shifts on Tuesdays from 7:45 - 8:45 pm or on Fridays from 3:30 to 4:30 pm
        at Britain Dining Hall.<br>
        We ask that volunteers sign up for shifts through our Orgsync page.
